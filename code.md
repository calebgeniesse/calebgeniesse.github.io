Below is a collection of code that I have developed throughout my research, with more recent work near the top. Most of these projects can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/calebgeniesse).


### Current research

- [dyneusr](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/). A Python visualization library for generating dynamical spatiotemporal representations of functional brain activity using topological data analysis. The package combines visual web components with a high-level Python interface for interacting with, manipulating, and visualizaing topological graph representations of high-dimensional neuroimaging data.

### Other projects

- *Coming soon...*
