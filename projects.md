Below are some of the projects I have developed throughout my research. Most of these (and more) can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/calebgeniesse).


### Recent projects

- **[DyNeuSR](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/).** A Python visualization library for topological representations of neuroimaging data. The package combines visual web components with a high-level Python interface for interacting with, manipulating, and visualizing topological graph representations of functional brain activity.

- **[DyNeuSR Fire](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr-fire/).** A command line interface for [DyNeuSR](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/) based on the [Python Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) library. The package wraps [KeplerMapper](https://kepler-mapper.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/) and [DyNeuSR](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/) into a single pipeline and automatically generates a simple command line interface that allows users to customize this pipeline.
