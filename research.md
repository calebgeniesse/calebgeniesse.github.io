### Background

My background includes education, training, and research in distinct but complementary scientific disciplines. Specific projects have included developing theoretical and computational models, tools, and approaches for studying biophysical systems: from atomistic simulations of proteins to whole-brain neuroimaging data. 

I earned my BS in [Molecular and Cellular Biology](https://mcb.illinois.edu/) from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), and prior to graduate school, I worked as a research programmer developing computational methods and citizen science biochemistry platforms for RNA structure design. 

During my first year of graduate school, I had the opportunity to try out several different areas of research (and scales of biology) through lab rotations. My projects included analyzing computer simulations and experimental measurements of GPCR protein dynamics, curating a deep learning benchmark for clinical drug toxicity prediction based on clinical trial data, and developing computational models to study the dynamics of modular attractor neural networks. Though I took a little longer than most, I found my home during a fourth rotation, exploring functional whole-brain imaging data using the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis.



### Current research

In the [brain dynamics lab @ stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/group/bdl/), my research bridges computational biophysics and neuroscience, and draws on ideas and tools from computer science to study the brain's rich spatiotemporal dynamics and their role in the neural basis of cognition.

My graduate research focuses on exploring how to apply ideas and algorithms from
topological data analysis (TDA) to capture and quantify fluctuations in brain dynamics. My initial work has focused on applying the Mapper algorithm from TDA and developing [dyneusr](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr), a new open-source visualization library for exploring graphical representations of high-dimensional neuroimaging data, and extracting computational insights that are robust against noise, reproducible, and biologically valid. This work builds on recent advancements in TDA that have enabled the characterization of the brainâ€™s dynamical organization during ongoing cognition without averaging data in space, time, or across participants at the outset. 

My research plans include developing new Mapper components that leverage biophysical knowledge and neurophysiology data sources (e.g. structural connectivity estimated from diffusion tensor imaging), and validating Mapper using persistent homology. I have also started exploring how Mapper (and other unsupervised techniques from TDA) can be combined with supervised learning approaches, for example, to develop more robust brain decoding models. 


### Future plans

Eventually, I'd like to apply these tools to clinical data to demonstrate how they enable researchers and clinicians to explore topological representations of neuroimaging data and generate biological insights underlying human cognition and complex mental disorders.

More broadly, equipped with training in biophysics and computational neuroscience, I hope to contribute to the advancement of our biophysical understanding of human cognition, and I hope to augment my current training and career development with complementary exposure to, and collaborative opportunities in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Open to future research opportunities in academia or industry, the ultimate aim of my work is to produce methods that can translate neuroscientific knowledge into clinical applications.
