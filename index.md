## Caleb Geniesse

I am a graduate student in the [Biophysics Program](http://med.stanford.edu/biophysics.html) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and currently a member of the [brain dynamics lab @ stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/group/bdl/). My current research centers around applying ideas from topological data analysis to neuroimaging data analysis and developing new computational tools to capture and quantify fluctuations in brain dynamics. 



## Current research

My current research projects include 
- Capturing and quantifying brain dynamics using machine learning and topological data analysis.
- Developing open-source software for extracting insights from high-dimensional brain imaging data.
- Building supervised brain decoding models based on ideas from topological data analysis.
- Validating topological models of brain dynamics using persistent homology.
