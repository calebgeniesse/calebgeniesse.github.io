I am a graduate student in Biophysics working with [Manish Saggar](https://web.stanford.edu/~saggar/newsite/index.html) in the [brain dynamics lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/bdl/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Here, I am developing new computational methods for capturing and quantifying fluctuations in brain dynamics using ideas from machine learning and topological data analysis (TDA). My initial work in the lab focused on applying the Mapper algorithm from TDA to neuroimaging data and developing [DyNeuSR](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr). More recently, I have been interested in optimizing Mapper for neuroimaging data and exploring how Mapper (and other unsupervised techniques from TDA) can be combined with supervised learning approaches, for example, to develop more robust brain decoding models. 

Before starting graduate school, I worked with [Rhiju Das](https://daslab.stanford.edu/) as a research programmer in the [Biochemistry](https://biochemistry.stanford.edu/) department at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). My research there focused on developing computational methods for studying biophysical systems, but my role and specific projects ranged from the in-house [Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) software developer implementing new algorithms for RNA structure modeling, to one of the main developers for the [EteRNA](https://eternagame.org) project leading a re-design of the popular citizen science game. 

I earned my BS in [Molecular and Cellular Biology](https://mcb.illinois.edu/) from the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).
