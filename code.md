Below is a collection of code that I have developed throughout my research, with more recent work near the top. Most of these projects can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/calebgeniesse).


### Current research

- [dyneusr](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/). A Python visualization library for generating dynamical neuroimaging spatiotemporal representations using topological data analysis. *dyneusr* provides a high-level interface for interacting with and manipulating shape graph representations of neuroimaging data and relating these representations back to neurophysiology.


### Other projects

- *Coming soon...*
