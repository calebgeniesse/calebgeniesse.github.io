title: About Me
---

I recently started my Postdoc in the [Machine Learning & Analytics Group](http://dav.lbl.gov/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/). Here, my research will explore visualization for scientific ML (e.g., developing new ways to visualize loss landscapes and characterize learning) with diverse scientific applications.
							  
I received my PhD in [Biophysics](http://med.stanford.edu/biophysics.html) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). For my dissertation, I worked with [Manish Saggar](https://web.stanford.edu/~saggar/newsite/index.html) in the [Brain Dynamics Lab](http://braindynamicslab.github.io/) to develop new computational methods for capturing and quantifying fluctuations in brain dynamics using ideas from machine learning and topological data analysis (TDA). My initial work in the lab focused on applying the Mapper algorithm from TDA to neuroimaging data and developing [DyNeuSR](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr). Other projects included optimizing Mapper for neuroimaging data and exploring how Mapper (and other unsupervised techniques from TDA) can be combined with supervised learning approaches, for example, to develop more robust brain decoding models. 

Before starting graduate school, I worked with [Rhiju Das](https://daslab.stanford.edu/) as a research programmer in the [Biochemistry](https://biochemistry.stanford.edu/) department at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). My research there focused on developing computational methods for studying biophysical systems, but my role and specific projects ranged from the in-house [Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) software developer implementing new algorithms for RNA structure modeling, to one of the main developers for the [Eterna](https://eternagame.org) project leading a re-design of the popular citizen science game. 

I earned my BS in [Molecular and Cellular Biology](https://mcb.illinois.edu/) from the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).
