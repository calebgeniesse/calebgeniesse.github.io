Below are some of the projects I have developed throughout my research. Most of these (and more) can also be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/calebgeniesse).


### Recent projects

- [**dyneusr**](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr/). A Python visualization library for topological representations of neuroimaging data. The package combines visual web components with a high-level Python interface for interacting with, manipulating, and visualizaing topological graph representations of functional brain activity.

- [**dyneusr-fire**](https://braindynamicslab.github.io/dyneusr-fire/). A command line interface for *dyneusr* based on the Python Fire library. The package wraps *kmapper* and *dyneusr* into a single pipeline and automatically generates a simple command line interface that allows users to customize this pipeline.
